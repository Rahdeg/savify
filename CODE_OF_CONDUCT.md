# Team Code of Conduct

## Purpose
This Code of Conduct outlines expectations for respectful communication, collaboration, and accountability while developing our group web application.

---

## Respect & Inclusion
All members will treat one another with respect and professionalism. We value diverse perspectives and are committed to maintaining an inclusive, supportive, and harassment-free environment.

---

## Communication
- **Primary communication channel:** WhatsApp
- Communicate clearly, honestly, and respectfully at all times.
- Team members should respond within **24 hours on weekdays**, unless communicated otherwise.
- Important decisions must be documented and shared with the team.
- Ignoring messages, sarcasm, public shaming, or dismissive behaviour is unacceptable.

---

## Meetings
- Meetings will be held **once per week**, or more frequently if required.
- All members are expected to come prepared and respect agreed meeting times.
- If a member is unable to attend, they must notify the team in advance and provide updates asynchronously.

---

## Work & Accountability
- Each member must actively contribute and have visible tasks in progress each week.
- Workloads will be distributed fairly and reviewed regularly.
- Team members must notify the group early if they are unable to meet a deadline.
- Internal deadlines will be set **48 hours before official submission deadlines**.

---

## Collaboration, Integrity, and Git Best Practices
- All decisions should be made collaboratively, with disagreements handled respectfully and professionally.
- Project objectives must always take precedence over individual preferences.
- **Direct pushes to the `main` branch are strictly prohibited.**  
  All development must be carried out on feature branches and merged through reviewed Pull Requests.
- All contributions must be original or properly credited and must comply with applicable licensing requirements.

---

## Git Workflow Guidelines
- Commit messages must be clear and professional, stating the type of change and a brief description.

  **Example:**
  ```bash
  git commit -m "FE: Implement payment screen"
  ```

- Branch names should follow the format: `initials_feature_name`

  **Example:**
  ```bash
  jd_payment_screen
  ```

- Function names must be meaningful and self-descriptive, clearly reflecting their purpose and behaviour.
- Always pull the latest changes from the main branch before creating or working on a new feature branch to avoid merge conflicts.

---

## Conflict Resolution & Non-Participation
- Issues should be addressed early and respectfully within the team.
- If a member becomes inactive:
    - A private check-in will be made to understand the reason for non-participation.
    - Tasks will be reassigned if necessary to avoid delays.
    - A formal warning will be issued if inactivity continues.
    - If non-participation occurs three consecutive times, the member will be removed from the group and the issue will be reported to the module lecturer
